To describe the position of each particle on each of the Stewart platforms, we need to define the coordinate system for the fixed base (BXYZ) and the coordinate system for the moving base (Axyz), which are the coordinate systems at the center of mass of each the platforms are placed. The connection points to the fixed and moving base (Bi, Ai) are shown in the figure below, where we will calculate the related vectors. Also, θp and θb, the separation angles between the points Ai and Bi, respectively, are shown in this Figure:

To find the position of a moving platform, we need to Describe it by two vectors; the position vector (P) and the rotational matrix (BRA). Then, We use the Jacobin matrix to make the relationship between the velocity of active joints (actuators) and the generalized velocity of the moving platform. 
To calculate the kinetic and potential energy of the legs, we assume that the legs are linear operators. In this case, each leg consists of two moving and fixed parts.

After calculating the kinetic and potential energy with generalized coordinates, we can obtain the general classical dynamic equations of motion using Lagrange's equation.
