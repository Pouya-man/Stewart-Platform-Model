# Stewart-Platform-Model

We used Plexiglass for the top platform. We used six servo motors for angular actuators and connected the motors to the upper platform using six long and six short links. We connected these links with 12 joints (Tie rod end ball joint). We used an Arduino Mega 2560 model for the controller because of its ease of coding and large number of input and output ports. Our primary input is the position of the ball on the top platform. To locate this ball, we used an image processing camera located at a reasonable distance above the leading platform.

In the ball and beam system (with the Stewart model), we can control the ball's position with other components on the upper platform and place it in any desired position. Among the things that this device does, the following can be mentioned:
  1. Centralize the position of the ball
  2. Fix the position of the ball in the desired coordinates
  3. Perform regular dynamic movements such as circular or rectangular movements

The use of the Stewart model in the aerospace and medical industries are just a few examples of the applications of this device. Due to the positioning of the device and its accuracy, it can be used more widely and can be generalized in various forms.
