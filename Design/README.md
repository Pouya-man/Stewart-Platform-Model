We had two ways to design our model. In the first model, linear actuators such as hydraulic jacks could be used. These linear actuators were also efficient for larger applications and sometimes even more accurate than the second model because both links connected to the joints were along, and the calculations became straightforward. In any design, accuracy, practicality, and costs should be considered. This method was more expensive compared to the second one, so we used the second method. Also, more studies were conducted on the first method than the second one. 

In the second model, we used cheaper angle operators. This method allowed us to use more economical parts in the design. We could also have more detailed studies using angular actuators instead of linear operators. For the calculations of both methods, almost similar mathematics was used. According to the designs, the second method can also be suitable for small applications. In the following, we will examine the design of some parts and their assembly.
